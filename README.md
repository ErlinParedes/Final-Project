Team MENJ: Mahmud Hasan, John Royal, Nur Mazumder, Erlin Paredes

This project aims to create a system that can recognize text.

I will be using the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images
and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, converted into black and
white, 28x28 pixel format.

Libraries used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Models Used
K-means
K-nearest-neighbors
Logistic regression
Neural Network
