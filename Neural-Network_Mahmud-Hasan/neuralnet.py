# 28 x 28 pixel image
# as the images are greyscale, each pixel has value 0 (black) to 255 (white)

# represent this first as a matrix, each row being an example and having 784 columns
# corresponding to each pixel in the image

# transpose this matrix such that each column is an example and each column has 784 rows

# input layer: 784 nodes for each pixel
# hiden layer: 10 nodes
# ouput laye: 10 nodes for each possible digit classification

# forward propegation
# running image through the network to see what network outputs
